            Project Name : Canteen Management System
            Prepared By: Raghav
                        
            Objective: This project will make the School/College Canteen Management easier for both Students and Canteen Workers. This is type of postpaid Canteen
                       where students can place order by showing their ID Cards (their roll no. as Customer ID) and can pay the bill later. This program keeps track
                       of what a customer has ordered in past and the total amount they have to pay all these things will be permanently store in files .
                       
            Note :~  Due to some reasons, this program isn't working correctly on Code::Blocks but i had checked it in linux g++ and there it is working fine. Kindly compile it using Dev-C++.
